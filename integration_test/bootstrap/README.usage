    Three principle scripts are used to build and setup the test environment:

    (1)  build_int_env.sh       - Builds the itest-edge, itest1, itest2 and itest3 virtual machines

       USAGE:  ./build_int_env.sh  6.5

       Dependencies:
          - packer
          - VirtualBoxManage

   (2)  init_host_bridges.sh    - Sets up the host-only 'bridges' on the mac/host machine

       USAGE:  ./init_host_bridges.sh

            Important point: Currently, the bridges are named "vboxnet0", "vboxnet1", "vboxnet2" & "vboxnet3". 
        They are *not* named "vnet-itest-0", "vnet-itest-1", etc. I will need to see how (if?) these
        names can be changed.

  (3)   system_startup.sh       - Imports the vm's built in step (1) into VirtualBox and boots them up
         
       USAGE:  ./system_startup.sh



  PROBLEMS:

      -  Not much testing!  I am able to ping between and ssh into these machines, but that is all
         the testing that has been done re: network connections.

      -  Not much cleanup!  I have kept output from these scripts (for example, packer template files)
         so that I can debug. 

      - !! I have not yet setup proper SSH'ing into the machines. Right now, I do it by hand. I will need
         to learn more about how this is done in the current (vmware) versions and implement it next week.

      - Containers are built (via lxc) on all machines, but that is all: No networking has been set up.

      - The code needs a lot of refactoring...
