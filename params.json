{"name":"Openvnet","tagline":"Data Center Level Virtual Network Toolkit based on Edge Overlaid Network using OpenFlow 1.3.","body":"OpenVNet\r\n========\r\n\r\nOpenVNet allows you to fully virtualize networking using [OpenFlow](http://archive.openflow.org). In theory, it should be able to implement virtual networks on top of any OpenFlow switch out there. In reality, we've only tested it on [Open vSwitch](http://openvswitch.org) so far.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we don't have any real body of documentation up yet. For now, please direct any questions about OpenVNet to the [Wakame Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wakame-ug). You are welcome to ask us anything. Be it 'what exactly does OpenVNet do?' or 'Why is this specialized OpenVNet installation of mine not working?'. There are no stupid questions and we do our best not to give stupid answers.\r\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n* Ruby version: 2.1.1\r\n* OS: CentOS 6.4 or higher\r\n* Open vSwitch version: 2.3.0 or higher\r\n\r\nOther versions or operating systems may or may not work.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- [Installation Guide](https://github.com/axsh/openvnet/blob/master/docs/InstallGuide.md)\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to all contributors for submitting patches.
