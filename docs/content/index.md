# What is OpenVNet?

OpenVNet is what you would call a network hypervisor. A network hypervisor provides a layer of abstraction on top of existing network hardware. Network engineers become able to create any network topology that they have in mind, without taking the existing hardware into account.

OpenVNet is free open source software. The source is [freely available on Github](https://github.com/axsh/openvnet). Everybody is welcome to contribute to development and the software can be freely distributed. (Within the rules of the LGPL license)

# Getting started

[Installation Guide](installation.md)

This guide will teach you how to set up the most basic OpenVNet environment possible which is just two VMs on the same host connected to [Open vSwitch](http://openvswitch.org). While this environment doesn't do anything you couldn't do with a basic Linux Bridge, it is a great entry point into the world of OpenVNet.

We hope to get more expansive guides up in the future. Until then we encourage you to play around and contact us for assistance if needed.

# Contact us

The best way to contact us is to send an e-mail to the [Wakame Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?#!forum/wakame-ug) on Google Groups. Please don't hesitate to ask us any questions. We realise OpenVNet is difficult to set up and that our documentation is limited at this time. If you want to try it out, we'll do our best to help you.

If you happen to be in Tokyo, you can also attend one of our Wakame Users Group events. They are open to everybody. Further details on http://wakameusersgroup.org.
